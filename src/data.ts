Upon guessing the word, the game will inform the player how many letters are correct (pigs) and how many words are correct and in the correct spot (bulls). I utilized React for the front-end of the game, allowing for a smooth and interactive user experience. The game logic was implemented using JavaScript, and the overall design and styling was achieved through the use of CSS. Overall, it was a great opportunity for me to further enhance my skills in these technologies and create a fun and engaging game for players.',

      'User can view gallery of horned animals as well as ðŸ–¤ their favorite ones. There is also a drop down menu that allows the user to search by the amount of horns an animal has to narrow down their search. First, I decided to use React as the framework for my project because of its versatility and ability to efficiently render components. I also used JavaScript and CSS to add interactivity and styling to the project. Next, I began by setting up the basic structure of the app and creating the components that would be necessary, such as the gallery and the drop down menu. I also gathered a list of horned animals and their respective images and information that I wanted to include in the gallery. Once the basic structure was in place, I began implementing the functionality for the drop down menu. This involved adding the search functionality and handling the users input to filter the gallery accordingly. Next, I focused on styling the app to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate. This involved adding custom CSS styles and ensuring that the layout was responsive and looked good on different devices. Finally, I tested the app thoroughly to ensure that it was functioning correctly and made any necessary adjustments. Once I was satisfied with the result, I deployed the app and made it available for users to view and interact with via netlify.',
